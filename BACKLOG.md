# Backlog

Items deliberately pushed out of the PR they came up in, with enough context
that whoever picks them up next has the working memory the original author
had. Sorted by component; within a component, no implied order — pick
whichever has the most leverage at the time.

When a PR notes something as "out of scope this commit," that line belongs
here. When an item lands, delete its bullet (its history is in `git log` and
`CHANGELOG.md`).

- **Drag-to-reorder columns in the Findings Queue.** The `visibleCols` array
  in localStorage `ir:queueColumns` is currently unordered with respect to
  the registry — toggling a column on inserts at its natural position in
  `FINDINGS_COLUMNS`. Letting the analyst drag headers to reorder is a
  shape change: `visibleCols` becomes meaningfully ordered, and the panel
  needs a drag handle per checkbox. (Source: claude/ir-findings-queue PR.)

- **Sort support for `user` / `filename` / `hash` columns.** The registry
  marks these `sortable: false` because `makeFindingComparator` doesn't know
  how to compare them. Teach the comparator the metadata-key fan-out
  (`md.user || md.sender || md.recipient || …` for user, etc.) and flip
  the registry flag. (Source: claude/ir-findings-queue PR.)

- **Surface-file extraction of `FindingsQueue` into
  `docs/wireframes/ir/surfaces/findings.jsx`.** The IR side of
  `siphon-ir.html` is one ~10k-line `<script type="text/babel">` block —
  the c2-side surface-split pattern (sync-shared.sh markers) doesn't apply
  cleanly until that mega-block is split. Doing the extraction is its own
  structural refactor PR; doesn't need to ride along with feature work.
